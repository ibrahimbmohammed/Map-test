          Welcome to our BotLab portal, also known as the Pre-Listing Assessment Lab, a space
          we&rsquo;ve created to introduce new bots from our research before their official listing.
          Here&rsquo;s what you can do:
          <br />
          <br />- Keep tabs on bot performance using Myfxbook data.
          <br />- Verify investor passwords and more, whether it&rsquo;s on a demo or live account
          funded to test the bot.
          <br />
          <br />
          Please note that accounts in the Pre-Listing Lab are not yet ready for copying until they
          pass our certification process. You can review their performances, and when they become
          available for copying, youâ€™re free to make your own choices.
          <br />
          <br />
          The exceptional bots listed below, part of our research, require you to obtain the
          investor password, verify their performance, and diligently monitor their progress on
          Myfxbook.
